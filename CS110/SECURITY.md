# Firebase Security Setup

## Overview
This project uses Firebase with proper security configurations to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Environment Variables
- All Firebase configuration values are stored in `.env` file
- The `.env` file is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
- Environment variables are validated at runtime

### 2. Firestore Security Rules
- Authentication required for all database operations
- Users can only read/write their own profile data
- Posts: users can read all, but only create/modify their own
- Comments: users can read all, but only create/modify their own
- Followers/Following: proper access controls for social features

### 3. Authentication
- Firebase Authentication is properly configured
- All database operations require authenticated users

### 4. App Check (Optional)
- App Check integration ready for production use
- Protects against abuse from non-app traffic
- Requires reCAPTCHA configuration in Firebase Console

## Setup Instructions

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in your Firebase project configuration
3. For production: configure App Check in Firebase Console and add the reCAPTCHA site key

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` file** - it's already in `.gitignore`
2. **Regularly review Firestore rules** - ensure they match your app's requirements
3. **Monitor Firebase Console** - check for unusual activity
4. **Use Firebase App Check in production** - protects against automated abuse
5. **Keep Firebase SDK updated** - latest versions include security patches

## Firebase Console Security Settings

### Authentication
- Enable only the sign-in methods you need
- Configure authorized domains for production

### Firestore Database
- Review and test security rules regularly
- Monitor usage patterns in the Firebase Console

### App Check (Production)
- Enable App Check in Firebase Console
- Configure reCAPTCHA Enterprise or reCAPTCHA v3
- Add the site key to your environment variables
